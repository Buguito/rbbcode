RbbCode is a customizable Ruby library for parsing BB Code. It attempts to follow OOP guidelines, so you should be able to change many aspects of its behavior by subclassing rather than monkeypatching.

RbbCode validates and cleans input. It supports customizable schemas so you can set rules about what tags are allowed where. The default rules are designed to ensure valid HTML output.

Example usage:

require 'rbbcode'

bb_code = 'This is [b]bold[/b] text'
parser = RbbCode::Parser.new
html = parser.parse(bb_code)
# => 'This is <strong>bold</strong> text'
